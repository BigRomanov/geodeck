Europe in general doesn’t seem so attractive for digital nomads, for some obvious reasons like costs, overdeveloped and little exotic destinations. But when you cannot travel as far as Southeast Asia, there might as well be some spots in Europe which are well worth a consideration. Such as the easy-going island of Malta.

Low cost & small language barrier Malta is a small independent state and one of the beautiful mediterranean islands in southern Europe, where the sun smiles all year round along with the locals. The island boasts a glorious variety of spectacular landscapes, bright blue sandy beaches while it offers a considerably low cost of living. Outdoor activities such as hiking, rock climbing and cycling are popular year-around. Oh and don’t miss the famous Blue Lagoon on Comino, the smallest of the three islands that make up Malta. The ease of communication is also a bonus with English being one of the official languages besides Maltese and widely spoken.
