The so-called Carbon Challenge is part of City Hall&#x2019;s ambitious plan to reduce all citywide greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050.</p>\n<p>The expansion to the 16 hotels &#x2014; which also include the Grand Hyatt New York, the Westin New York at Times Square and The Peninsula New York among others &#x2014; is estimated to reduce emissions by 32,000 metric tons and result in an estimated $25 million in energy cost savings. Environmental advocates largely praised the move, suggesting that enlisting a few high-profile structures to the cause could spur others to join.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As the nation&#x2019;s number one big city destination, the hotels are showing the rest of the world that our city is committed to reducing our carbon emissions and fighting climate change,&#x201D; said Herv&#xE9; Houdr&#xE9;, general manager of the InterContinental New York Barclay.</p>\n<p>City officials said that more than 17 universities, 11 hospitals and nearly 20 residential property management companies &#x2014; combining for nearly 7 percent of citywide building-based emissions &#x2014; have already signed on to the mayor&#x2019;s program. Officials estimate that the program overall will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 515,000 metric tons &#x2014; the equivalent of taking 100,000 cars off the roads.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<aside class=\"post-up-next alignright\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<aside class=\"alignright tall-ad-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</aside>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t</div>", "author": null, "domain": "skift.com", "dek": null}
